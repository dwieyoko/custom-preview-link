== Description ==
Preview Link Generator is a plugin to help you create demo/preview links for your WordPress themes, plugins, HTML templates preview.

[Live Demo](https://bootstrap.hasthemes.com/preview/buznex/) | [Contact Us](https://hasthemes.com/contact-us/)

To sell software products (i.e. WP themes/plugins/templates), it is badly necessary to show the live preview or demo link on the product page. Demo/preview link helps customers understand how your products work and helps a customer make the decision faster to purchase your products. 

Normally, the demo/preview links are hosted on a subdomain or another domain. When any customer will click on the preview link, it means that the visitor is leaving your web, which increases the bounce rate of a website. Bounce rate is the percentage of your visitors of your website who move from the site after viewing only one page. The bounce rate should be in the 26% to 40% range. 

So if you create a demo/preview link using our plugin, customers will be able to check the demo from your website without leaving your website.

Also, as the page has the iframe content, we have added the index, nofollow meta tag, so that Web page shouldn't be indexed/Followed by search engines, which helps your website to improve the overall SEO quality score. 

**Plugin Settings:**

* Custom description for meta description
* Iframe URL
* Buy Now Button Text
* Buy Now Button URL
* Back Button Text
* Back Button URL
* Slug rewrite options
* Favicon Uploader
